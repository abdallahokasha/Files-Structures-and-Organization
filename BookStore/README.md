### This is simple Library using C++ files

We can run the code using Xcode or CodeLite or any other C++ IDE

##### The design contains two main classes (Library & Book) and the application is managed by the _Library_ class through its methods:
- Add Book
- Edit Book
- Search for Book (by Id)
- Delete book
- Save Books (to file - books.txt) 
- Retrieve books from file

###### The Records (books) are written on the file delimited by '#' and the fields of each book are delimited by '|' 
Example:
```
1|title1|author1|descritption1|#2|title2|author2|descritption2|#
```
