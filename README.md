This Repo contains source codes in c, to (add, update, search, delete) Variable length delimited fields files. we can find that in `book.cpp`.

In `bookIndex.cpp`, we use index table to refer to each record in the file and any edits on it will be reflected to index file/table.

In `Hashing.cpp`, we use hash tables concept to handle file records using hashing methods:
1. Progressive Overflow
2. Double Hashing
3. Scatter Tables
