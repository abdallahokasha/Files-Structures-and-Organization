This Repo contains source codes in c, to (add, update, search, delete) [Variable length delimited fields]records we can find it in book.cpp.

in bookIndex.cpp, we use index table to refer to each record in the file and any edits on it will be reflected to index file/table.

in Hashing.cpp, we use hash table to deal with each record in the file (using hashing methods 1-progressive overflow, 2- double hashing, 3-scatter tables)
